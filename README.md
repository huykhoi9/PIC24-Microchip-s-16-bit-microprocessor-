# Project Interfacing Sensors Using I2C Protocol

In this project, I coded in C program to receive data from a temperature sensor through PIC24 MCU and display it in virtual terminals. For the temperature sensor, I used DS1631 which is a high precision digital thermometers provide 9, 10, 11, or 12-bit temperature readings over a -55°C to +125°C range with ±.1°C accuracy. It also has an industry-standard 2-wire which is compatible with I2C serial interface. Then I used UART serial communication to receive messages from PIC24 and display information in the virtual terminal.
